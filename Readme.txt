Description:
==========================
You are a simple Space-Engineer shortly before finishing his last day at work and being off to retirement as the phone rings and he is handed down one small last task.
An A.I. on the interstellar defense platform "N3-BUL-0N" has gone mad and threatens to destroy planet earth. 
Being the one with the most experience, you are entrusted in reaching the platform's core and pull the plug. 

If only it were that easy... 


Installation Instructions: 
==========================
//Right now, only widescreen monitors are supported. Else, some parts of the levels will be cut off. Sorry!
 

How To Play:
==========================
Destroy the terminals to open the doors and get to the end in time before the A.I. closes up your way further into the platform.
Look out for the right colors on the terminals as well as the wires on the doors.

You can shoot projectiles or run up the terminals to destroy them.
